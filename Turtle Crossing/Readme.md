# Turtle Street Crossing Game
A simple Python game implemented using the turtle module, where the player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy road without getting hit by cars.
## Game Description
The game window is set up with a width of 600 pixels and a height of 600 pixels. The turtle starts at the bottom of the screen and can move up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys. The player's goal is to safely cross the road without getting hit by the passing cars, which are generated by the CarManager class.

The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the turtle successfully crosses the road. However, if the turtle gets hit by a car, the game is over, and the player can restart the game by clicking anywhere on the screen.

## Installation
